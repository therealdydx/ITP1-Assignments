# Intro to Programming 1 Assignments
This repository consists of assignments and game projects as part of the module, done in JavaScript.  

# Assignment Files
p5.js library was used for the Sleuth assignments, which are the Sketch.js files in each case folder in the Sleuth folder.   
This repository also contains a game project assignment as part of the course requirements.
